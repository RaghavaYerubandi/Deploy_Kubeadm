# ConfigMaps
- Configmaps used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. 
- A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.
