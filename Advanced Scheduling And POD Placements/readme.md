# Advanced Scheduling And POD Placements
- Advanced Scheduling and POD Placements in K8s involve techniques and configurations that ensure PODs are scheduled on the most appropriate nodes in the cluster.
- Using the techiques we can optimize resources utilization, echance performance and ensure high availability.
- By default PODs will schedule on the workernodes. We can change this scheduling using the below advanced scheduling techniques.

**Key Concepts in Advance scheduling**
- Node Selector
- Affinity and Anti-affinity
- Taints and Tolerations
- POD Topology spread constraints
- Custom Schedulers
- Resource requests and limits
- Daemonsets
