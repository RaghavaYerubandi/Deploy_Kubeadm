# Ingress Controller and Ingress Resources
- In K8s ingress controller and ingress resources work together to provide http & https routing to services within a cluster.
- They manage external access to the services, typically through http/https and also handle features like loadbalancing and SSL termination and Name based virtual hosting.

**Advantages**
- Routing based on domain name to different services.
- SSL termination.
- Can use single LoadBalancer instead of multiple.
